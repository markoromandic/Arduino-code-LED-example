# Arduino-code-LED-example

Arduino code LED example was written as a part of course Compiler Construction at The Faculty Of Computer Science.

Project was designed and written by me.

### Funcionality:
* Two Groups of LED lights
* Potentimeter influences on speed of changing intensity of the LED lights
* Button press prints on serial intensity values of the LED lights
* You can enter formula(A+B*P/C) to change speed of changing intensity od the LED lights.

### Setup
*Prepare breadboard with six LED lights connected to digital pins, potentiometer, button and corresponding resistors.
*Default digital pins for LED lights are: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11
*Default digital pin for button is: 2
*Default analog pin for potentiometer is: 0

### Formula variables:
* A, B, C are float numbers
* P is value of the potentiometer
